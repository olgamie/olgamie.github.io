      <description>TL;DRI show an approach to building a first baseline model using random forest (RF).I use DALEX package to understand a random forest built with ranger package, simplify it, improve performance, and run time. I use recipes package to handle categorical variables, missing values, and novel levels.
Random forest and first baselineRandom forest is a powerful and flexible model that is relatively easy to tune. This is why it’s usually a top candidate to start with and build the first baseline.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, July 7th I organized a breakout session Tackling Climate Change at a virtual useR!2020 Munich.When I submitted the proposal I hoped the session will be a mix of an invited talk, climate-related contributions submitted to the useR! and an open discussionbetween R users and researchers. In an online setup, the final session schedule was a bit different.
The session lasted almost 2 scheduled hours. Around 130 people joined the session.</description>

      <description>What is a Data Science Salary Survey?At the end of 2019 as one of the Warsaw R Enthusiasts Meetup initiatives I designed a salary survey for broadly understood data science/data analysis/machine learning job market in Poland. This exercise was inspired by the similar survey from Germany. A survey was advertised using social media among the R/data science/machine learning community. Despite Meetup organizers’ attempts to reach as many people in the community as possible, I acknowledge that these results don’t represent everyone on the Polish data science scene.</description>
