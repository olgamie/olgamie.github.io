      <description>A quick look into paid leave available to momsI was recently researching maternity leave options in Poland. In simplification as a mother in Poland you can get:
a year of a paid leave at a rate 80% (20 weeks of maternity leave and 32 of parental leave)half a year (20 weeks maternity leave + 6 weeks parental leave) paid 100% and another half 60% (26 weeks of parental leave).</description>

      <description>It is a challenge to choose a name for your baby. At least it has been for me. To make this decision easier I wanted to look into current trends, as neither my husband nor I wanted a baby to have a super popular name. If you want to know what names are currently trending in Poland this post is for you.
Polish Ministry of Digitalization publishes the baby names statistics.</description>
