      <description>TL;DRI show an approach to building a first baseline model using random forest (RF).I use DALEX package to understand a random forest built with ranger package, simplify it, improve performance, and run time. I use recipes package to handle categorical variables, missing values, and novel levels.
Random forest and first baselineRandom forest is a powerful and flexible model that is relatively easy to tune. This is why itâ€™s usually a top candidate to start with and build the first baseline.</description>
