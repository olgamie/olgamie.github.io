      <description>I used data from iWildCam 2020 Kaggle competition to practice machine learning vision after completing fast.ai deep learning course.I manage to build a solution that achived 77% accuracy on the test set in classifying animals on the camera trap photo, which places the solution in the top 10% of this competition (11/121).I build two models: the first model was a ResNet50 on the original images just resized, with data augmentation, mixup and TTA, the second model was also ResNet50 build on the cropped images to bboxes detecting the animals.</description>
