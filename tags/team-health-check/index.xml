      <description>One of the most crucial factors for a company to be successful is to have thriving teams. So for me, the health of the team is a very crucial KPI.
At Appsilon we look at team health at various levels. We use Officevibe to track different team metrics on a company level and within different teams (tech team vs.Â operations etc.). Engineering managers hold regular 1-on-1 meetings with their reports.</description>
