      <description>TL;DRI used data from iWildCam 2020 Kaggle competition to practice machine learning vision after completing fast.ai’s deep learning course.I managed to build a solution that achieved 78% accuracy on the test set in classifying animals on the camera trap photo, which places the solution in the top 10% of this competition (10/126).I built two models: the first model is a ResNet50 on the original images but resized, with moderate data augmentation, mixup and TTA, the second model is also ResNet50 built on the cropped images to bboxes detecting the animals.</description>

      <description>What is a Data Science Salary Survey?At the end of 2019 as one of the Warsaw R Enthusiasts Meetup initiatives I designed a salary survey for broadly understood data science/data analysis/machine learning job market in Poland. This exercise was inspired by the similar survey from Germany. A survey was advertised using social media among the R/data science/machine learning community. Despite Meetup organizers’ attempts to reach as many people in the community as possible, I acknowledge that these results don’t represent everyone on the Polish data science scene.</description>
